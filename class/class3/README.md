Class 3 â€“ Introduction to Great Lakes and HPC
=============================================

Goal
----

- In this module, we will learn how to work with files and directories using Data Carpentry lesson - [Working with Files and Directories](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/03-working-with-files/index.html)
- We will set up our compute environment for upcoming lab modules so that we have all the tools installed and ready for use.
- We will learn how to load Great lakes modules i.e pre-installed softwares provided by ARC-TS team.
- We will submit our first job to the cluster.


Directory organization for the course
-------------------------------------
In the first class on Great Lakes we worked in our home directory and copied files over there. For the remainder of the course we will be working in our course home directories. The reason for this is that your home directory is only accessible to you. However, we want to be able to share files, work in teams and have instructors review your work. To accomplish this we have worked with the administrators to setup this course directory with the neccesary permissions to do all of this! To go to this directory use the following cd command (and don't forget about your tab completes!):

```
#Go to the class directory
cd /scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/

#Check out what's here
ls
```

You will notice that each of you should have your own home directory where you will do work for the class, and also complete your assignments. You will also notice that there is a shared_data directory, where bioinformatics programs and data for the course live. 

One final thing which you might ask yourself is how is it that certain users can access certain directories/files, while others can't? For instance, you can acceess your own course home directory, but not that of your classmates. Similarly, you can all access the shared_data directory, but users not in the class can't. Well, an important thing to be aware of when working in a Unix environment is that users who create files and directories have very tight control over who can read, write or execute the files or within the directories. If you try to go somewhere you don't have permission or perform an operation on a file that you don't have permissions for, then you will be a permission denied error. 

So, how do you know what the permissions are and how do you alter them? To examine the permissions we can provide the '-l' flag to ls, which stands for list. The '-l' flag provides an expanded listing, which provides information on who owns a file/directory and what it's permissions are. Permissions are organized into three blocks indicating read, write and execute permissions for the owner, the group member and everyone else. For instance, the following permission string would be read as follows:

rwxrw-r--

1) rwx : The owner can read, write or execute  
2) rw- : Group members can read or write, but not execute
3) r-- : Everyone else can read, but not write or execute

For any file you create, you have the  power to change permissions using the 'chmod' command. For example, if we wanted to change permission so the user can do anything, the group members can read only and others can't do anything, then we could run the following command

```
chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx example_file 
```

Setting up your compute environment
-----------------------------------

**Setting up environment variables in .bashrc file so your environment is all set for genomic analysis!**

Environment variables are the variables/values that describe the environment in which programs run in. All the programs and scripts on your unix system use these variables for extracting information such as: 

- What is my current working directory?, 
- Where are temporary files stored?, 
- Where are perl/python libraries?, 
- Where are my tools installed? etc. 

In addition to environment variables that are set up by system administators, each user can set their own environment variables to customize their experience. This may sound like something super advanced that isn't relevant to beginners, but that's not true! 

Some examples of ways that we will use environment variables in the class are: 

1) Create shortcuts for directories that you frequently go to,

2) Setup a conda environment to install all the required tools and have them available in your environment

3) Setup a shortcut for getting on a cluster node, so that you don't have to write out the full command each time.

As an example, let's look at one of the most important environment variables, called the 'PATH' variable. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories where Unix will look whenever you execute a program or run a command. For instance, when you do something as simple as type 'pwd', the operating system looks in the directories listed in your PATH variable to see if any of them contain a program named 'pwd'. By default, your PATH is setup to include directories where all the Unix commands we have learned live. During the course we will be using some bioinformatics programs that we have performed custom installs on, so we will need to add the directories where we have installed these to the PATH. We will see in a moment how to change an environment variable, but let's quickly see how to see what's in one. To examine the contents of an environment variable we use the 'echo' command. For example, to look at your PATH variable type the following:

```
echo $PATH
```

You will see that PATH contains a colon separated list of paths. So, when you execute a command, Unix goes in order through this list to see if the program exists. We will look at the PATH variable again after we have added to it!


One way to set your environment variables would be to manually set up these variables everytime you log in, but this would be extremely tedious and inefficient. So, Unix has setup a way around this, which is to put your environment variable assignments in special files called .bashrc or .bash_profile. Every user has one or both of these files in their home directory, and what's special about them is that the commands in them are executed every time you login. So, if you simply set your environmental variable assignments in one of these files, your environment will be setup just the way you want it each time you login!

All the softwares/tools that we need in this workshop are installed in a directory 

`/scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/bin` 

and we want the shell to look for these installed tools in this directory. 

For this, We will save the full path to these tools in an our PATH variable.

> ***i. Make a backup copy of bashrc file in case something goes wrong.***
	
```

cp ~/.bashrc ~/bashrc_backup_2022_01_05

#Note: "~/" represents your home directory. On great lakes, this means /home/username

```
	
> ***ii. Open ~/.bashrc file using any text editor and add the following lines at the end of your .bashrc file.***

***Note: Replace "username" under alias shortcuts with your own umich "uniqname".***

There are many different programs that can be used to edit files in a Unix environment. Some of them are extremely complex and powerful, others are simple and there are even options that have a graphical interface for those of you craving that :). In class we will use the most basic text editor available, which is called nano. To edit the .bashrc file, type the follow command.

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Once you are in nano you can immediately type and edit. Once you are ready to save and exit, do the following:

1. Save - type ctl-o and then enter
2. Exit - type ctl-x


Now, let's past the below into your .bashrc:

```

# .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi

# Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's auto-paging feature:
# export SYSTEMD_PAGER=

# User specific aliases and functions

# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/sw/arcts/centos7/python3.8-anaconda/2021.05/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/sw/arcts/centos7/python3.8-anaconda/2021.05/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/sw/arcts/centos7/python3.8-anaconda/2021.05/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/sw/arcts/centos7/python3.8-anaconda/2021.05/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<

##epid582 ENV

#Aliases
alias islurm='srun --account=epid582w22_class --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem-per-cpu=5GB --cpus-per-task=1 --time=12:00:00 --pty /bin/bash'
alias wd='cd /scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/username/'

#Great Lakes Modules. They should remain commented until ready for use.
#module load Bioinformatics
#module load perl-modules

#Bioinformatics Tools installed outside the conda environment due to dependency conflicts.
export PATH=$PATH:/scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/bin/quast-5.0.2


```



Note: Replace "username" under alias shortcuts with your own umich "uniqname". In the text editor, nano, you can do this by 

- typing Ctrl + \ and You will then be prompted to type in your search string (here, username). 
- Press return. Then you will be prompted to enter what you want to replace "username" with (here, your uniqname). 
- Press return. Then press a to replace all incidences or y to accept each incidence one by one. 

You can also customize the alias name such as wd, d1am etc. catering to your own need and convenience.

The above environment settings will set various shortcuts such as "islurm" for entering interactive great lakes session, "wd" to navigate to your workshop directory, call necessary great lakes modules and perl libraries required by certain tools and finally sets the path for bioinformatics programs that we will run during the class.

> ***iii. Save the file and Source .bashrc file to make these changes permanent.***

```

source ~/.bashrc

```

> ***iv. Check if the $PATH environment variable is updated***

```

echo $PATH

#You will see a long list of paths that has been added to your $PATH variable

wd

```

You should be in your class working directory that is /scratch/micro612w21_class_root/micro612w21_class/username 

> ***v. Set up a conda environment using a YML file***

The YML file - `MICRO582.yml` required for generating the conda environment is located here:

```
/scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/conda_envs
```

Load great lakes anaconda package and set up a conda environment in the following way - 

```
# Load anaconda package from great lakes 
module load python3.8-anaconda/2021.05

# Set channel_priority to false so that it can install packages as per the YML file and not from loaded channels.
conda config --set channel_priority false

# Create a new conda environment - micro612 from a YML file
conda env create -f /scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/conda_envs/MICRO582.yml -n MICRO582

# Load your environment and use the tools
conda activate MICRO582

# Create Conda environment for MultiQC 
conda create -n multiqc multiqc
```
Working with Files and Directories
----------------------------------

We will again use [this](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/03-working-with-files/index.html) data carpentry material to learn how to work with files and directories. 

Data for this lesson is located here - `/scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/data/class3`

Change your current location to your working directory and copy class3 folder to your working directory.

```
cd /scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/username

cp -r /scratch/epid582w22_class_root/epid582w22_class/shared_data/data/class3 ./
```

Change directory to class3

```
cd class3
```


Loading modules
---------------
Great Lakes also provide support for the installation of Bioinformatics software which can be accessed by loading Bioinformatics module.

```
module load Bioinformatics
```

To check which tools are available under the Bioinformatics module, 

```
module av
```

Use the space key to explore the entire suite of tools that are available from Great Lakes. We can load any of these tools using `module load toolname` command.

Submit a job to cluster
-----------------------

Great lakes supports SLURM batch scheduler and resource manager that allows us to run a job on University of Michiganâ€™s high performance computing (HPC) clusters. [This](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/slurm-user-guide/) website provides a great oevrview of the process for submitting and running jobs under the Slurm Workload Manager on the Great Lakes cluster.

Open first_job.sbat using nano and change SLURM directives mail-user to reflect your email ID.

Submit your first SLURM job with 

```
sbatch first_job.sbat
```
