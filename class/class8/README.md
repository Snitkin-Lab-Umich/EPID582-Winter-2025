Class 8 â€“ Data download and genome comparison
=============================================

Goal
----

- In this class, we will learn about NCBI public database and how to download entire datasets peratianing to a research study using SRAtoolkit.
- We will then apply the QC skills that we learned in our previous class such as FastQC and MultiQC to assess the downloaded dataset.
- We will then do a quick genomic comparison of the downloaded dataset using Mashtree. 

### Add NCBI database stucture descriptions.
### Difference between Bioproject, Biosample, SRA accession.

Download datasets from NCBI using SRA toolkit
------------------------------------------------

Lets start an interactive session to start the download of the subset of data.

```
islurm

wd

mkdir class8

cd class8/

#Create condo environment and install SRA toolkit, mashtree
conda create -n class8 -c bioconda sra-tools mashtree

conda activate class8

fasterq-dump -h

mashtree -h

# Use this or just provide them with the SRA accessions. Whichever makes it less confusing. 
# Esearch/Esummary/Xtract can be a little intimidating at first.
# Lets keep it simple and just provide them with the 3o SRA accession from PRJEB2111 stucy.
# esearch -db sra -query PRJEB2111 | esummary | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Experiment@acc,Run@acc,Platform@instrument_model,Sample@acc | head -n30 > PRJEB2111-info_30_samples.tsv

for accession in $(cut -f2 PRJEB2111-info_30_samples.tsv); do printf "\n  Working on: ${accession}\n\n"; fasterq-dump ${accession};  done

ls
```

Compare genomes using Mashtree
------------------------------

```
islurm

#Fastest way to get the Mashtree
time mashtree --numcpus 8 *.fastq --outtree mashtree_faster.dnd --outmatrix mashtree_faster.tsv

#real	6m49.139s
#user	6m32.699s
#sys	0m12.186s

```
