Class 8 â€“ Data download and genome comparison
=============================================

Goal
----

- In this class, we will learn about NCBI public database and how to download entire datasets peratianing to a research study using SRAtoolkit.
- We will then apply the QC skills that we learned in our previous class such as FastQC and MultiQC to assess the downloaded dataset.
- We will then do a quick genomic comparison of the downloaded dataset using Mashtree. 

### Add NCBI database stucture descriptions.
### Difference between Bioproject, Biosample, SRA accession.


Download data for a Bioproject using SRA toolkit
