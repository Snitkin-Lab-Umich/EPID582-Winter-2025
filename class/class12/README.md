=======================================================

Goals
----
- Learn how to work with DNA sequence data in R
- Learn how to create Neighbor Joining trees in R
- Learn how to visualize phylogenetic trees with associated meta-data in R
- Learn how to interpret phylogenetic trees in the context of an epidemiologic question

R packages for phylogenetic analysis
-------------------------------------
During this session we will exclusively be working with the ape package, which has a multitude of functionality for working with sequence data, trees and making corresponding visualizations. However, there are many other useful packages in R that are worth a look!

A few noteworthy R packages:
1. [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/ape.pdf)
2. [phytools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phytools/index.html) (phylogenetic functions and tree visualization)
3. [ggtree](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/) (package for advanced tree visualization)
4. [phangorn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html) (phylogenetic functions and tree visualization)
