The RStudio Interface and setting up an RProject
------------------------------------------------
Check out this Data Carpentry overview of the [RStudio interface](https://datacarpentry.org/R-genomics/00-before-we-start.html)

In order for us to all work in the same environment we are going to create an RProject. RProjects are a nice way to organize all of your scripts and data for a project in a self-contained work area. To create an RProject for the class:

1. Under the File menu, click on New project, choose New directory, then Empty project
2. Enter a name for this new folder, and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the course (e.g., ~/epid5)
3. Confirm that the folder named in the Create project as a sub-directory of box is where you want the working directory created. Use the Browse button to navigate folders if changes are needed.
4. Click on “Create project”
5. Under the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data within your newly created working directory. (e.g., ~/data-carpentry/data)
6. Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working directory (e.g. class_11_introR.R)
