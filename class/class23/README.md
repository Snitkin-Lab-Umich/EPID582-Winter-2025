Class 23 â€“ SARS-CoV-2 genomic data QC and cluster detection
===========================================================

Goals
----
- Learn about the impact that variant filtering can have on data analysis
- Explore the amount of genetic variation present at the early stages in the emergence of a exponentionally spreading pathogen
- Consider the importance of having contextual isolates in interpretting genomic clusters

Setup
-----
We are going to be working in RStudio again today. Take the following steps to get ready for the lab:

1. Start up your epid582 Rproject and create a new directory in it called class23 to hold data we will be analyzing today. 
2. Go on to Great Lakes and copy over the class 23 files to your working directory
3. Use cyberduck to bring the files down to the class23 directory you created on your own computer

Background on lab and data set
------------------------------
Today we will be analyzing some data generated by collaborators at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) in Chicago. The objective of their study was to understand whether healthcare workers (HCWs) were acquiring SARS-CoV-2 patients. To this end they sequenced the following:

1. All SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from HCWs in March and April 2020
2. All SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from in-patients in March and April 2020
3. A background data of SARS-CoV-2 samples that were processed by the RUMC clinical microbiology lab during the same time period. This includes samples from a drive through testing site and emergency room visits.

We will go through the actual steps we took in analyzing this genomic data. These steps include the following:

1. Performing filtering of variants based on recommendations at the time
